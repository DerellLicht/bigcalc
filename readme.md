<ins>BigCalc 6.0 - BigCalc ported to 32-bit Windows console utility</ins>

The original BigCalc was an extended-precision scientific calculator, supporting numbers
up to 1000 digits.  
It was written by Judson D. McClendon for MSDOS, ca 1999.

I ported it to 32-bit Windows console utility, and it still works great!

The original readme file is included as bigcalc.txt
