<ins>BigCalc 6.0 - BigCalc ported to 32-bit Windows console utility</ins>

BigCalc was an extended-precision scientific calculator, supporting numbers
up to 1000 digits.  
The original program was written by Judson D. McClendon for MSDOS, ca 1999.  
Neither the author nor the original program appear to be present on the internet any more.

I ported it to 32-bit Windows console utility, and it still works great!

The original readme file is included as bigcalc.txt
