<ins>BigCalc 6.0 - BigCalc ported to 32-bit Windows console utility</ins>

The original BigCalc was an extended-precision scientific calculator, supporting numbers
up to 1000 digits.  
It was written by Judson D. McClendon for MSDOS, ca 1999.  Neither the author nor the
original program appear to be present on the internet any more.

I ported it to 32-bit Windows console utility, and it still works great!

The original readme file is included as bigcalc.txt
